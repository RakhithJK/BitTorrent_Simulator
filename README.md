# Bittorrent_Simulator_WIP
Peer-To-Peer file transfer
- Small version of Bit-torrent implementation
- Server introduces the file into the p2p file sharing network by distributing pieces of files, and sets 
  up the client to finish up the transfer among themselves
- Clients establish connections with other clients to upload/download file chunks till they obtain the entire file.
